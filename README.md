Highlight
=========

Highlight is a simple syntax highlighting plugin for Ruby on Rails. It's basically a
wrapper around the popular [http://pygments.org](http://pygments.org) highlighter that's
written in Python and supports an impressive number of languages.

If pygments is installed on the machine and in the `PATH`, that binary is used, otherwise
the plugin falls back to the web API at [http://pygments.appspot.com/](http://pygments.appspot.com/),
created by Trevor Turk.

See the API docs at [http://rdoc.info/projects/simplabs/highlight](http://rdoc.info/projects/simplabs/highlight).

Usage
-----

Highlight provides a new method that's available in views:

    highlight_code(language, code = nil, &block)

`language` may be either a Symbol or a String (see supported languages
below). The code can be passed either as a string or inside a block, e.g.:

    highlight_code(:ruby, 'class Test; end')

or

    highlight_code(:ruby) do
      klass = 'class'
      name  = 'Test'
      _end  = 'end'
      "#{klass} #{name}; #{_end}"
    end

To perform the highlighting, the code is first written to a temporary file e.g.:

    /tmp/simplabs_highlight_1225993290.70882

This file is then passed to pygments that returns the HTML and so on...

Since writing that file, passing its contents on to pygments, retrieving the result etc.
takes a while, all highlighted source code should be cached, e.g.:

    <%- code = 'class Test; end' -%>
    <%- cache Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(code) do -%>
      <%= highlight_code(:ruby, code) -%>
    <%- end -%>


Supported Languages
-------------------

The following languages are supported (there are probably more that are supported by `pygments`).
All of the paranthesized identifiers may be used as parameters for highlight to denote the
language the source code to highlight is written in (use either Symbols or Strings).

  * Actionscript (`as`, `as3`, `actionscript`)
  * Applescript (`applescript`)
  * bash (`bash`, `sh`)
  * C (`c`, `h`)
  * Clojure (`clojure`)
  * C++ (`c++`, `cpp`, `hpp`)
  * C# (`c#`, `csharp`, `cs`)
  * CSS (`css`)
  * diff (`diff`)
  * Dylan (`dylan`)
  * Erlang (`erlang`, `erl`, `er`)
  * HTML (`html`, `htm`)
  * Java (`java`)
  * JavaScript (`javascript`, `js`, `jscript`)
  * JSP (`jsp`)
  * Make (`make`, `basemake`, `makefile`)
  * Objective-C (`objective-c`)
  * OCaml (`ocaml`)
  * Perl (`perl`, `pl`)
  * PHP (`php`)
  * Python (`python`, `py`)
  * RHTML (`erb`, `rhtml`)
  * Ruby (`ruby`, `rb`)
  * Scala (`scala`)
  * Scheme (`scheme`)
  * Smalltalk (`smalltalk`)
  * Smarty (`smarty`)
  * SQL (`sql`)
  * XML (`xml`, `xsd`)
  * XSLT (`xslt`)
  * YAML (`yaml`, `yml`)


Installation
------------

Installation is as easy as

    ./script/plugin install git@github.com:simplabs/highlight.git

The hightlight.css stylesheet that contains the neccessary style
definitions is copied to your

    public/stylesheets

directory automagically.

If you don't have python and pygments installed, you will need that too.
For instructions on installing pygments, refer to
[http://pygments.org/docs/installation/](http://pygments.org/docs/installation/).
